# Numpy-Pandas
Use 2 datasets to perform data abstraction, slicing, dicing and basic analysis using Pandas Series and DataFrame.
Problem 1
mtcars.csv – Dataset extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine comprising fuel consumption and 10 aspects (attributes) of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles is a famous problem dataset used in machine learning and data analysis. We will use this dataset to perform data abstraction, slicing, dicing and basic analysis using Pandas Series and DataFrame, as taught in the class.

One of the main purpose of this data was to assist decision making on which car to purchase during the 1973 Oil Crisis which began in October 1973, when the members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries proclaimed an oil embargo and the affected countries were Canada Japan, Netherlands, United Kingdom and United States and later extended to Portugal, Rhodesia and South Africa. By the end of the embargo in March 1974, the oil price had risen nearly 400%, from $3 per barrel to nearly $12 globally; US prices were significantly higher. The embargo caused an oil crisis, or "shock", with many short and long-term effects on global politics and the global economy. It was famously called the “First Oil Shock”.
